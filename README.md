# TurtleGame
This game was made as part of a presentation for the Theory of Graphs and Networks class at UA. It demonstrates some of the applications of simple graph algorithms in video games.

Running game.py will start a new game. It takes a little while for the map to be drawn, because Turtle Graphics was used, but you get to watch it happening. The map is procedurally generated by making a Minimum Spanning Tree using Kruskal's algorithm. Once the map has been drawn, you can move your blue turtle by using the W, A, S, and D keys and hitting enter. Multiple movement commands can be inputted on a single line before hitting enter. The goal is to reach the yellow treasure square, and then take the treasure to the red escape square. The other turtles will try to catch you. The yellow turtles guard the room they spawn in, and the red turtle moves towards either the treasure or the escape tile. If you enter a turtles line of sight, it will start following you. Movement towards a specific target uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path.
